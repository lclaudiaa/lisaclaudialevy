	<h2> What is the objective of your website? </h2>
	<p> 
        My objective is to display pictures and videos of all my past projects. I divided my projects into three types based on my three passions; creativity, entrepreneurship and impact. My goal is to give references to my future business collaborators or employers about my competencies and the types of projects that I can do. 
        This website is made to complement my cv, as well as to add a more personal touch.
